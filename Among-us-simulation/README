*RotateMatrix - I noticed a pattern in the strings by studying the 'ref' files and
 computed the string directly. Initially, I created the matrix and then iterated over
 it in the required order but it was slower and affected the 4th Test. Also, when 
 I used the 'strcat' function it took almost 6 minutes for the 4th Test to be checked.

*DecodeString - I userd the 'strtok' function to get the numbers from the string
and converted them using 'atoi'.

*KillPlayer - computes the distance between each crewmate and the impostor and
always checks for the minimum distance. The last crewmate who has the minimum 
distance is considered the closest one. If it is within the killRange and it's
alive, it can be killed.
